## **Proposal for ROMS monthly aggregated statistics**

Statistics based on shelf & slope waters (\< 1000 m bottom depth)

### Depth:

Surface (to 10 m depth)

Bottom (to 10 m from bottom)

Midwater (10 m to 10 m from bottom)

### Area: 

NMFS statistical areas + Canadian waters

610, 620, 630, 640, 650, Canada

## Other specialized statistics:

Coastal current intensity?

Onshore/offshore transport?

## Variables to report:

Temperature

Salinity

\[Nitrate\]?

\[Ammonia\]?

\[Iron\]?

Along shelf transport

Across shelf transport

Small phytoplankton biomass and production

Large phytoplankton biomass and production

Small microzooplankton biomass and production

Large microzooplankton biomass and production

Small (coastal) copepod biomass and production

Large (*Neocalanus*) copepod biomass and production

Euphausiid biomass and production

\[Detritus\]?
